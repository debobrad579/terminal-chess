# Terminal Chess in C

A simple terminal-based chess program written in C. Play a full game of chess entirely in the terminal.

## Features
- Move input uses standard algebraic notation (eg. `e4`, `Nbd2`, `O-O`, `fxg8=N+`)
- Validates legal moves
- Detects check, checkmate, stalemate, threefold repetition, and the 50-move rule
- Supports resignation and draw offers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Youâ€™ll need:
- A C compiler (eg. `gcc`, `clang`)
- `make` (optional, but recommended)

### Clone the Repository
